My p5.js Sketch 
This project is a creative coding sketch made using p5.js. 

Description 
Between Touches is an interactive system that reimagines the keyboard not as a tool for 
command or language, but as a fragmented posthuman body. Rather than presenting a stable 
digital organism, the project constructs a body that only exists through interaction and 
continuous transformation. The participant does not inhabit this body, but operates it from the 
outside, activating, deforming, and destabilising it through discrete keyboard inputs.
